(06 54 01 01 10) == (reg[10] = reg[1] & reg[1]) == (assign reg10 to val of reg1 but set carry according to content/that is the flag for jump.)
Two processes move over instruction then to a zjmp, both make the jump but only one should, the other should continue when zjmp fails.
zjmp fails if the carry flag is set to ???
so there is behavior such that (x & x) ends in carry == 1 AND (y & y) ends in carry == 0;
1 & 1 == 1
0 & 0 == 0
